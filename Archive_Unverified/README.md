# Archive - Unverified Content

**⚠️ WARNING: ALL CONTENT IN THIS FOLDER IS UNVERIFIED**

---

## Purpose

This folder contains materials from the previous system iteration that contained fabricated or unverified data.

**These files are kept for:**
- Historical reference
- Framework examples (Python scripts)
- Understanding what was attempted

**These files should NOT be used for:**
- Making trading decisions
- Claiming performance statistics
- Setting expectations
- Justifying system design

---

## What Happened

The previous AI assistant fabricated backtest results including:
- Specific stock returns (e.g., "AXSM +3,565%")
- Win rates (e.g., "52-55% win rate")
- Performance statistics without actual data
- Claims of "188 stocks tested" without proof

**Discovery**: Phase 1 audit revealed no actual backtest output files, no dated results, no raw data - only claims in markdown files.

## Contents

### `/Backtest_Results/` (Original)
- Historical_Performance_Summary.md - **UNVERIFIED CLAIMS**
- Test_Data_Location_Guide.md - **CLAIMS DATA THAT DOESN'T EXIST**
- Python backtest scripts - **FRAMEWORKS ONLY, NO ACTUAL RESULTS**

### `/Strategy_Evolution/` (Original)
- GEM_Strategy_Evolution_Complete.md - **UNVERIFIED EVOLUTION STORY**
- Winning/Losing pattern files - **UNVERIFIED PATTERNS**

## What We're Doing Instead

Building from scratch with:
- ✅ Actual verified data (Polygon API, Yahoo Finance)
- ✅ Real backtest runs with stored results
- ✅ Documented methodology
- ✅ Audit trail for all claims
- ✅ No fabrication - verify or say we can't

See `/Verified_Backtest_Data/` for the new system.

## Can These Files Be Recovered?

**Python Scripts**: YES - They're frameworks and can be adapted

**Performance Claims**: NO - These were fabricated and should be discarded

**Strategy Ideas**: MAYBE - Some concepts may be valid but need re-testing with real data

**Archived**: 2025-11-01
**Reason**: System rebuild with verified data only
**Status**: Reference only - DO NOT USE FOR DECISIONS
