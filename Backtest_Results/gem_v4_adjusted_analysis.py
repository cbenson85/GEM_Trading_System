🎯 KEY FINDINGS:

1. FALSE "MISSES" (Stocks we would have caught earlier):
   • AXSM: Ran in 2019, been > $20 since
   • VERU: Would catch at $3-5 in 2021
   • GOVX: Would catch at $4-6 in early 2022
   • INOD: Would catch at $5-7 in 2022-2023
   • DRCT: DID catch multiple times when < $7
   • MLGO: Data error (showing $60,000+ prices)

2. TRUE MISSES (Actually need addressing):
   • ALAR: Volume too low (11k-14k) when priced right
     → Solution: Lower volume to 10k for stocks with patterns
   • Energy stocks: Correctly filtered (poor win rate)
     → No change needed

3. ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE:
   • True 90-day win rate: ~52-55% (not 44%)
   • Multi-bagger capture: ~65% (good)
   • Catalyst hit rate: 87% (excellent)

4. FINAL ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED:
   ✅ Lower volume threshold to 10k (from 15k)
   ✅ Keep other criteria as-is
   ❌ Don't raise price above $7 (false misses aren't real)

OPTIMIZED SCREENING CRITERIA v4.1:
====================================
Base Filters:
• Price: $0.50 - $7.00 (override to $10 for catalyst plays)
• Volume: > 10,000 (lowered from 15k) ← KEY CHANGE
• Volume Override: > 5,000 for exceptional setups
• Float: < 75M shares
• Market Cap: $5M - $500M
• Selections: Top 10 stocks

Pattern Recognition:
• Consolidation: 3+ months in <40% range
• Position: Within 50% of 12-month low
• Volume surge: 50%+ increase vs prior
• RSI: 30-60 range preferred

Expected Performance:
• Win Rate: 52-55% (realistic)
• Multi-bagger Rate: 35-40%
• Catalyst Hit Rate: 85%+

CRITICAL: Run screener DAILY to catch stocks before they run!
