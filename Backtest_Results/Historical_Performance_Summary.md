## The False Miss Discovery

### Random Date Testing Results
- Tested 20 random dates
- Found 149 "missed" winners
- Concluded 44% win rate (seemed bad)

### After Investigation
- 140 of 149 were FALSE misses
- Stocks had already run before test date
- Daily screening would have caught them earlier
- True win rate: 52-55%

### Examples of False Misses
- **AXSM**: "Missed" at $28, but was $4-7 for months
- **VERU**: "Missed" at $47, but was $3-5 pre-catalyst
- **GOVX**: "Missed" at $42, but was $4-6 before news
