## üî¨ BACKTESTING METHODOLOGY

### Approach

1. Find stocks with 500%+ gains via AUTOMATED GitHub Actions scan
2. Deep dive into 180 days PRE-CATALYST for each stock
3. Analyze: price, volume, sentiment, leadership, news, patterns
4. Identify correlations between explosive stocks
5. Build screener based on correlations
6. Backtest on random historical dates
7. Apply FALSE MISS principle to discarded stocks
8. Track picks AND discards with full performance data
9. Refine until consistent 10-year performance
10. Store ALL data for future refinement
11. ALL VIA GITHUB ACTIONS - zero manual work except triggering


### Current Progress

PHASE 2 COMPLETE: ‚úÖ
- Full 10-year scan: 244 total explosive stocks found
- Clean dataset: 170 stocks (2014-2019, 2022-2024)
- COVID-era archived: 69 stocks (excluded from analysis)
- Data quality: Verified via Polygon API + Yahoo Finance
- Ready for Phase 3: Pre-catalyst analysis

NEXT: Analyze 180 days BEFORE each explosion to find patterns


### Data Sources

- Price/Volume: Polygon API (via GitHub Actions - no network restrictions)
- Automation: GitHub Actions (runs on GitHub servers)
- Backup: Yahoo Finance (if Polygon fails)
- Manual Input: None - fully automated


---

## üìà DISCOVERED PATTERNS

### Verified Correlations
NONE YET - Will be discovered during analysis phase

### Current Scoring Criteria
CURRENT v5.0.1 CRITERIA - Will be updated based on pattern discovery

### Refinement History
No refinements yet - starting fresh

---

## üéØ DECISIONS MADE

### Key Decisions
1. Mark all previous backtest results as UNVERIFIED
2. Clear all current portfolio positions - starting fresh
3. Build from verified data only - no fabrication
4. Use 500%+ in 6 months as explosive stock criteria
5. Analyze 180 days pre-catalyst for pattern discovery
6. Store all backtest data (picks AND discards) for refinement
7. Apply false miss principle in all backtests
8. User only does copy/paste - full automation required
9. Free data sources only (no paid APIs except Polygon)
10. Use GitHub Actions for full automation (no local execution)
11. Exclude 2020-2021 from pattern discovery (COVID-era market anomalies)


### Rules Established
1. NEVER fabricate data - verify or say you can't
2. FALSE MISS CHECK - Always check discarded stocks for explosive growth
3. STORE EVERYTHING - All decisions, data, refinements must be saved
4. COPY/PASTE ONLY - User should never manually enter data
5. 10-YEAR VALIDATION - System must prove consistency before live trading
6. COVID-ERA EXCLUSION: Ignore 2020-2021 data (stimulus, zero rates, pandemic anomalies) - not repeatable conditions


---

## üìù WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT

### Immediate Next Steps
1. USER ACTION: Upload 3 catalog files to GitHub
   - explosive_stocks_catalog.json (raw)
   - explosive_stocks_CLEAN.json (for analysis)
   - explosive_stocks_COVID_ERA.json (archived)
2. AI ACTION: Begin pre-catalyst deep dives on clean stocks
3. AI ACTION: Extract patterns from 180 days before explosions
4. AI ACTION: Build correlation matrix
5. AI ACTION: Create screener criteria from patterns


### Blockers/Questions
None - data ready for analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NO FABRICATION**: All data must be verified. If unsure, say so immediately.
2. **FALSE MISS PRINCIPLE**: When backtesting, check discarded stocks for explosive growth
3. **USER DOES COPY/PASTE ONLY**: All automation, no manual data entry for user
4. **STORE EVERYTHING**: All backtest data, decisions, refinements must be saved
5. **10-YEAR VALIDATION**: System must work consistently across 10 years before live use

---

## üöÄ HOW TO CONTINUE

1. Read this entire prompt
2. Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
3. Confirm you understand current state and next phase
4. Wait for user approval before proceeding
5. Update this prompt after each phase completion
