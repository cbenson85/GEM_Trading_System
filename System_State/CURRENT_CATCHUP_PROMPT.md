GEM Trading System - AI Catch-Up Prompt
Last Updated: 2025-11-01 21:00:53
System Version: 5.0.1-REBUILD
Current Phase: Phase 3: Stock Discovery & Catalog Building

üéØ CRITICAL CONTEXT
What You're Walking Into
System being rebuilt from ground up. Previous model fabricated backtest data. Starting fresh with verified data only.
Immediate Priority
User runs explosive stock scanner locally, then we analyze results

üìä SYSTEM STATUS
Current State

Portfolio: CLEARED - Starting fresh
Cash Available: $10,000 (reset)
System Stage: Pre-Development - Planning & Infrastructure
Last Completed Phase: Phase 2: System Requirements & Data Infrastructure - COMPLETE
Next Phase: Phase 3: Stock Discovery (awaiting local scan results)

Data Verification Status

Current Prices: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (Polygon API)
Volume Data: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (Polygon API)
Float Data: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (Polygon API - not all stocks)
Backtest Results: ‚ùå UNVERIFIED (marked for removal)
Catalyst Data: ‚ùå NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
Historical Analysis: ‚ùå NOT YET STARTED


üóÇÔ∏è FILE STRUCTURE & LOCATIONS
Core System Files (VERIFIED)

/Current_System/GEM_v5_Master_Screening_Protocol.md - Core screening rules
/Current_System/Trading_Rules_Complete.md - Trading operations guide
/Polygon_Integration/daily_screener.py - Working Polygon integration
/Daily_Operations/CURRENT_UPDATE.md - Daily update template

Data Files (Location & Status)

/Verified_Backtest_Data/ - ‚úÖ CREATED (empty, awaiting scan results)
/Verified_Backtest_Data/explosive_stocks_catalog.json - ‚úÖ TEMPLATE CREATED
/Verified_Backtest_Data/pre_catalyst_analysis/ - ‚úÖ FOLDER CREATED
/Verified_Backtest_Data/backtest_runs/ - ‚úÖ FOLDER CREATED

/Verified_Backtest_Data/refinement_history.json - ‚úÖ TEMPLATE CREATED
/Archive_Unverified/ - ‚úÖ CREATED (old backtest files marked unverified)

Unverified/Archived Content

/Backtest_Results/ - MARKED UNVERIFIED, kept as framework reference
/Strategy_Evolution/ - MARKED UNVERIFIED, contains unproven claims
All Python backtest scripts - MARKED UNVERIFIED, frameworks only


üî¨ BACKTESTING METHODOLOGY
Approach

Find stocks with 500%+ gains in any 6-month window (last 10 years)
Deep dive into 180 days PRE-CATALYST for each stock
Analyze: price, volume, sentiment, leadership, news, patterns
Identify correlations between explosive stocks
Build screener based on correlations
Backtest on random historical dates
Apply FALSE MISS principle to discarded stocks
Track picks AND discards with full performance data
Refine until consistent 10-year performance
Store ALL data for future refinement

Current Progress
Infrastructure complete - awaiting 10-year explosive stock scan results
Data Sources

Price/Volume: Polygon API (Developer tier) + Yahoo Finance backup
News/Sentiment: Web scraping (Google, Yahoo Finance)
Insider Trading: Free sources (Finviz, OpenInsider, SEC Form 4)
SEC Filings: SEC EDGAR (free)
Float/Shares: Polygon API + manual verification


üìà DISCOVERED PATTERNS
Verified Correlations
NONE YET - Will be discovered during analysis phase
Current Scoring Criteria
CURRENT v5.0.1 CRITERIA - Will be updated based on pattern discovery
Refinement History
No refinements yet - starting fresh

üéØ DECISIONS MADE
Key Decisions

Mark all previous backtest results as UNVERIFIED
Clear all current portfolio positions - starting fresh
Build from verified data only - no fabrication
Use 500%+ in 6 months as explosive stock criteria
Analyze 180 days pre-catalyst for pattern discovery
Store all backtest data (picks AND discards) for refinement
Apply false miss principle in all backtests
User only does copy/paste - full automation required
Free data sources only (no paid APIs except Polygon)

Rules Established

NEVER fabricate data - verify or say you can't
FALSE MISS CHECK - Always check discarded stocks for explosive growth
STORE EVERYTHING - All decisions, data, refinements must be saved
COPY/PASTE ONLY - User should never manually enter data
10-YEAR VALIDATION - System must prove consistency before live trading


üìù WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT
Immediate Next Steps

USER ACTION: Download scanner and run locally on Windows machine
USER ACTION: Upload explosive_stocks_catalog.json results to GitHub
AI ACTION: Analyze discovered explosive stocks
AI ACTION: Build pre-catalyst analysis framework
AI ACTION: Begin 180-day deep dives on explosive stocks

Blockers/Questions
Network restrictions prevent running scanner in Claude environment - requires local execution
