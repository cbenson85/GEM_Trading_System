## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR AI - READ THIS FIRST

### 1. FILE CATALOG MUST BE UPDATED FOR EVERY FILE CREATION - NO EXCEPTIONS!

When AI creates ANY file:
1. ✅ Create file with download link
2. ✅ **IMMEDIATELY UPDATE GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ⏳ PENDING status**
3. ✅ Post GitHub URL for user to copy
4. ✅ Wait for user to upload and paste back
5. ✅ Verify file via web_fetch
6. ✅ **UPDATE GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ✅ VERIFIED status**
7. ✅ Update CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md if major milestone

**This is MANDATORY. Not optional. Not negotiable. ALWAYS.**

See [FILE_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbenson85/GEM_Trading_System/refs/heads/main/FILE_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md) for complete workflow.

### 2. CATCH-UP PROMPT + SYSTEM_STATE.JSON ARE PAIRED FILES - UPDATE BOTH!

**When CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md is updated, system_state.json MUST be updated too!**

These files work together:
- **CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md** = Human-readable narrative
- **system_state.json** = Machine-readable structured data

They must ALWAYS have:
- ✅ Matching timestamps
- ✅ Matching current phase/status
- ✅ Matching next steps
- ✅ Same key information

**Never update one without the other!**

## 🔬 SUSTAINABILITY FILTER V2.0

### Filter Criteria (FINALIZED)
- **Test Window**: 21 days after peak (not 30)
- **Retention Threshold**: 80% of peak gain (not 90%)
- **Test Method**: Use Polygon API to find actual catalyst windows

### How It Works
1. **Read CLEAN.json** (200 stocks to test)
2. **For each stock:**
   - Use Polygon API to scan stock's year for explosive window
   - Find 180-day window with 500%+ gain
   - Get catalyst start date (entry date)
   - Get peak price (highest in window)
   - Get test price (21 days after peak)
   - Calculate: `retention = (test_price - entry_price) / (peak_price - entry_price)`
3. **Filter results:**
   - Sustainable (≥80%): Stay in CLEAN.json
   - Unsustainable (<80%): Move to UNSUSTAINABLE.json

### Performance (Developer Tier)
- **API Access**: Unlimited requests (Developer tier)
- **Rate Limiting**: Minimal (0.1s delay between stocks)
- **Expected Runtime**: 5-15 minutes for 200 stocks ⚡
- **Not 2-4 hours. Not 8-13 hours. MINUTES!**

### Expected Results
- **Sustainable stocks**: ~60-120 (30-60% of original 200)
- **Unsustainable stocks**: ~80-140 (pump & dumps, untradeable flukes)
- All data preserved in respective files
- Detailed statistics in sustainability_summary.json

### Files Created by Filter
1. **explosive_stocks_CLEAN.json** - MODIFIED (sustainable stocks only)
2. **explosive_stocks_UNSUSTAINABLE.json** - CREATED (pump & dumps)
3. **sustainability_summary.json** - CREATED (statistics)

---

## 📈 DISCOVERED PATTERNS

### Verified Correlations
NONE YET - Will be discovered during Phase 3 analysis of SUSTAINABLE stocks only

### Current Scoring Criteria
CURRENT v5.0.2 CRITERIA - Will be updated based on Phase 3 pattern discovery from sustainable stocks

### Refinement History
4 refinements logged:
1. System reset (2025-11-01) - Cleared unverified data
2. COVID-era exclusion rule (2025-11-01) - Exclude 2020-2021 from patterns
3. Expanded historical coverage (2025-11-02) - Added 2010-2012 data (11 stocks)
4. Sustainability filter V2.0 (2025-11-02) - 21-day, 80% retention test

---

## 🎯 DECISIONS MADE

### Key Decisions
1. ✅ Mark all previous backtest results as UNVERIFIED
2. ✅ Clear all current portfolio positions - starting fresh
3. ✅ Build from verified data only - no fabrication
4. ✅ Use 500%+ in 6 months as explosive stock criteria
5. ✅ Analyze 180 days pre-catalyst for pattern discovery
6. ✅ Store all backtest data (picks AND discards) for refinement
7. ✅ Apply false miss principle in all backtests
8. ✅ User only does copy/paste - full automation required
9. ✅ Free data sources only (no paid APIs except Polygon)
10. ✅ Exclude COVID-era (2020-2021) from pattern analysis
11. ✅ Implement merge logic in filter to prevent data loss
12. ✅ Fix GitHub Actions workflow for full automation (no manual filter runs)
13. ✅ Expand historical coverage back to 2010 for more data
14. ✅ Create comprehensive pre-catalyst analysis framework (12 categories)
15. ✅ Test sustainability BEFORE pre-catalyst analysis (filter out pump & dumps)
16. ✅ Use 21-day, 80% retention as sustainability criteria
17. ✅ Only analyze sustainable stocks for pattern discovery

### Rules Established
1. **NO FABRICATION** - Verify or say you can't
2. **FALSE MISS CHECK** - Always check discarded stocks for explosive growth
3. **STORE EVERYTHING** - All decisions, data, refinements must be saved
4. **COPY/PASTE ONLY** - User should never manually enter data
5. **10-YEAR VALIDATION** - System must prove consistency before live trading
6. **FILE VERIFICATION** - Every file must be verified using the established protocol
7. **DATA PRESERVATION** - Filter script uses merge logic (no data loss on subsequent scans)
8. **FULL AUTOMATION** - Workflow handles scanning, filtering, and committing without manual steps
9. **SUSTAINABILITY FIRST** - Test for tradeability before spending weeks on analysis
10. **DEVELOPER TIER OPTIMIZED** - Use unlimited API access for fast results

## 🔐 FILE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

### **The Problem We Solved:**
AI was creating files without verifying it could read them back from GitHub. This created broken links and lost context between sessions.

### **The Solution - REQUIRED WORKFLOW:**

**When AI Creates New File(s):**

**Step 1**: AI provides files & posts to catalog
- Create file(s) with download links
- Provide file information (location, purpose, contents)
- Immediately update GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ⏳ PENDING status

**Step 2**: AI constructs & posts URLs
- Construct raw GitHub URL(s): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbenson85/GEM_Trading_System/refs/heads/main/[FILE_PATH]`
- Post URLs in plain text for easy copying
- Say: "Copy these URLs and paste them back after upload:"

**Step 3**: User uploads & pastes URLs back
- User uploads file(s) to GitHub
- User copies the URL(s) from chat
- User pastes them back in chat

**Step 4**: AI verifies files
- AI uses web_fetch on each pasted URL
- AI confirms file contents
- AI updates GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ✅ VERIFIED status
- AI updates CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md if needed

### **Critical Rules:**
- ❌ **AI CANNOT** fetch raw GitHub URLs directly without user providing them first
- ✅ **AI CAN** fetch URLs that user pastes back
- 🔄 **EVERY file** created must follow this verification workflow
- 📝 **EVERY verification** updates the catalog and this prompt
- 🚫 **NO EXCEPTIONS** - If file isn't verified, it doesn't exist to AI
