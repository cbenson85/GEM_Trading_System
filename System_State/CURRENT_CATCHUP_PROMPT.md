## 🔬 BACKTESTING METHODOLOGY

### Approach

1. ✅ Find stocks with 500%+ gains in any 6-month window (last 10 years) - COMPLETE
2. ❌ Deep dive into 180 days PRE-CATALYST for each stock - Phase 3
3. ❌ Analyze: price, volume, sentiment, leadership, news, patterns - Phase 3
4. ❌ Identify correlations between explosive stocks - Phase 3
5. ❌ Build screener based on correlations - Phase 3+
6. ❌ Backtest on random historical dates - Phase 4+
7. ❌ Apply FALSE MISS principle to discarded stocks - Phase 4+
8. ❌ Track picks AND discards with full performance data - Phase 4+
9. ❌ Refine until consistent 10-year performance - Phase 4+
10. ✅ Store ALL data for future refinement - Infrastructure ready

### Current Progress

**Phase 1**: Discovery & Documentation Audit - ✅ COMPLETE
**Phase 2**: System Requirements & Data Infrastructure - ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ 10-year explosive stock scan complete (244 stocks)
- ✅ COVID-era filter applied (170 clean, 69 archived)
- ✅ File verification protocol established
- ✅ Data backup system fixed (merge logic)
- ✅ All infrastructure verified and working

**Phase 3**: Stock Discovery & Pre-Catalyst Analysis - ❌ NOT STARTED
- ❌ Deep-dive 180-day pre-catalyst analysis
- ❌ Pattern discovery across 170 clean stocks
- ❌ Correlation matrix building
- ❌ Screener criteria extraction

### Data Sources

- Insider Trading: Free sources (Finviz, OpenInsider, SEC Form 4)
- SEC Filings: SEC EDGAR (free)
- Float/Shares: Polygon API + manual verification

## 📈 DISCOVERED PATTERNS

### Verified Correlations
NONE YET - Will be discovered during Phase 3 analysis

### Current Scoring Criteria
CURRENT v5.0.1 CRITERIA - Will be updated based on Phase 3 pattern discovery

### Refinement History
2 refinements logged:
1. System reset (2025-11-01) - Cleared unverified data
2. COVID-era exclusion rule (2025-11-01) - Exclude 2020-2021 from patterns

---

## 🎯 DECISIONS MADE

### Key Decisions
1. ✅ Mark all previous backtest results as UNVERIFIED
2. ✅ Clear all current portfolio positions - starting fresh
3. ✅ Build from verified data only - no fabrication
4. ✅ Use 500%+ in 6 months as explosive stock criteria
5. ✅ Analyze 180 days pre-catalyst for pattern discovery
6. ✅ Store all backtest data (picks AND discards) for refinement
7. ✅ Apply false miss principle in all backtests
8. ✅ User only does copy/paste - full automation required
9. ✅ Free data sources only (no paid APIs except Polygon)
10. ✅ Exclude COVID-era (2020-2021) from pattern analysis
11. ✅ Implement merge logic in filter to prevent data loss

### Rules Established
1. **NO FABRICATION** - Verify or say you can't
2. **FALSE MISS CHECK** - Always check discarded stocks for explosive growth
3. **STORE EVERYTHING** - All decisions, data, refinements must be saved
4. **COPY/PASTE ONLY** - User should never manually enter data
5. **10-YEAR VALIDATION** - System must prove consistency before live trading
6. **FILE VERIFICATION** - Every file must be verified using the established protocol
7. **DATA PRESERVATION** - Filter script uses merge logic (no data loss on subsequent scans)

---

## 📝 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT

### Phase 3 Tasks (READY TO BEGIN)
1. Create pre-catalyst analysis framework
2. Deep-dive analyze 170 clean explosive stocks (180 days before explosion)
3. Extract common patterns across successful stocks
4. Build correlation matrix
5. Identify screening criteria based on patterns
6. Document all findings in /Verified_Backtest_Data/

### Blockers/Questions
NONE - All infrastructure complete, ready to proceed

## 🔐 FILE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

### **The Problem We Solved:**
AI was creating files without verifying it could read them back from GitHub. This created broken links and lost context between sessions.

### **The Solution - REQUIRED WORKFLOW:**

**When AI Creates New File(s):**

**Step 1**: AI provides files & posts to catalog
- Create file(s) with download links
- Provide file information (location, purpose, contents)
- Immediately update GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ⏳ PENDING status

**Step 2**: AI constructs & posts URLs
- Construct raw GitHub URL(s): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbenson85/GEM_Trading_System/refs/heads/main/[FILE_PATH]`
- Post URLs in plain text for easy copying
- Say: "Copy these URLs and paste them back after upload:"

**Step 3**: User uploads & pastes URLs back
- User uploads file(s) to GitHub
- User copies the URL(s) from chat
- User pastes them back in chat

**Step 4**: AI verifies files
- AI uses web_fetch on each pasted URL
- AI confirms file contents
- AI updates GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ✅ VERIFIED status
- AI updates CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md if needed

### **Critical Rules:**
- ❌ **AI CANNOT** fetch raw GitHub URLs directly without user providing them first
- ✅ **AI CAN** fetch URLs that user pastes back
- 🔄 **EVERY file** created must follow this verification workflow
- 📝 **EVERY verification** updates the catalog and this prompt
- 🚫 **NO EXCEPTIONS** - If file isn't verified, it doesn't exist to AI

## 🔄 DATA BACKUP SYSTEM (FIXED 2025-11-02)

### **The Problem:**
Original filter script OVERWROTE CLEAN.json and COVID.json files on each run, causing data loss when incremental scans ran.

### **The Solution:**
Updated `filter_covid_era.py` with **MERGE LOGIC**:

**How It Works:**
1. Filter loads existing CLEAN.json and COVID.json (if they exist)
2. Filter reads new stocks from catalog.json
3. Filter merges new stocks (checks for ticker+year duplicates)
4. Filter saves updated cumulative files

**Result:**
- ✅ No data loss on subsequent scans
- ✅ No duplicates (ticker+year key)
- ✅ Accumulates findings over time
- ✅ catalog.json remains "latest scan snapshot"

**Example:**
```
Scan 1 (Full 10-year): catalog.json (244 stocks)
→ Filter: CLEAN.json (170) + COVID.json (69)

Scan 2 (Just 2024): catalog.json (1 stock)
→ Filter: Loads existing 170, adds 1 new = 171 total
         (or skips if duplicate)

No data loss! ✅
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NO FABRICATION**: All data must be verified. If unsure, say so immediately.
2. **FALSE MISS PRINCIPLE**: When backtesting, check discarded stocks for explosive growth
3. **USER DOES COPY/PASTE ONLY**: All automation, no manual data entry for user
4. **STORE EVERYTHING**: All backtest data, decisions, refinements must be saved
5. **10-YEAR VALIDATION**: System must work consistently across 10 years before live use
6. **FILE VERIFICATION**: Every file must be verified using the protocol above
7. **DATA PRESERVATION**: Filter uses merge logic - existing data is never lost

---

## 🚀 HOW TO CONTINUE

1. Read this entire prompt
2. Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
3. Confirm you understand current state and next phase
4. Wait for user approval before proceeding with Phase 3
5. Update this prompt after each phase completion
6. **VERIFY FILES**: Follow verification protocol for any new files
