# GEM Trading System - AI Catch-Up Prompt
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-01 21:13:36
**System Version**: 5.0.1-REBUILD
**Current Phase**: Phase 3: Stock Discovery & Catalog Building

---

## üéØ CRITICAL CONTEXT

### What You're Walking Into
System being rebuilt from ground up. Previous model fabricated backtest data. Starting fresh with verified data only.

### Immediate Priority
User uploads scanner + workflow to GitHub, runs automated scan via Actions

---

## üìä SYSTEM STATUS

### Current State
- **Portfolio**: CLEARED - Starting fresh
- **Cash Available**: $10,000 (reset)
- **System Stage**: Pre-Development - Planning & Infrastructure
- **Last Completed Phase**: Phase 2: System Requirements & Data Infrastructure - COMPLETE
- **Next Phase**: Phase 3: Stock Discovery (awaiting local scan results)

### Data Verification Status

- Current Prices: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (Polygon API)
- Volume Data: ‚úÖ VERIFIED (Polygon API)
- Float Data: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (Polygon API - not all stocks)
- Backtest Results: ‚ùå UNVERIFIED (marked for removal)
- Catalyst Data: ‚ùå NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- Historical Analysis: ‚ùå NOT YET STARTED

## üóÇÔ∏è FILE STRUCTURE & LOCATIONS

### Core System Files (VERIFIED)

- `/Current_System/GEM_v5_Master_Screening_Protocol.md` - Core screening rules
- `/Current_System/Trading_Rules_Complete.md` - Trading operations guide
- `/Polygon_Integration/daily_screener.py` - Working Polygon integration
- `/Daily_Operations/CURRENT_UPDATE.md` - Daily update template
                

### Data Files (Location & Status)

- `/Verified_Backtest_Data/` - ‚úÖ CREATED (empty, awaiting scan results)
- `/Verified_Backtest_Data/explosive_stocks_catalog.json` - ‚úÖ TEMPLATE CREATED
- `/Verified_Backtest_Data/pre_catalyst_analysis/` - ‚úÖ FOLDER CREATED
- `/Verified_Backtest_Data/backtest_runs/` - ‚úÖ FOLDER CREATED  
- `/Verified_Backtest_Data/correlations_discovered.json` - ‚úÖ TEMPLATE CREATED
- `/Verified_Backtest_Data/refinement_history.json` - ‚úÖ TEMPLATE CREATED
- `/Archive_Unverified/` - ‚úÖ CREATED (old backtest files marked unverified)


### Unverified/Archived Content

- `/Backtest_Results/` - MARKED UNVERIFIED, kept as framework reference
- `/Strategy_Evolution/` - MARKED UNVERIFIED, contains unproven claims
- All Python backtest scripts - MARKED UNVERIFIED, frameworks only

## üî¨ BACKTESTING METHODOLOGY

### Approach

1. Find stocks with 500%+ gains via AUTOMATED GitHub Actions scan
2. Deep dive into 180 days PRE-CATALYST for each stock
3. Analyze: price, volume, sentiment, leadership, news, patterns
4. Identify correlations between explosive stocks
5. Build screener based on correlations
6. Backtest on random historical dates
7. Apply FALSE MISS principle to discarded stocks
8. Track picks AND discards with full performance data
9. Refine until consistent 10-year performance
10. Store ALL data for future refinement
11. ALL VIA GITHUB ACTIONS - zero manual work except triggering


### Current Progress
Infrastructure complete - awaiting 10-year explosive stock scan results

### Data Sources

- Price/Volume: Polygon API (via GitHub Actions - no network restrictions)
- Automation: GitHub Actions (runs on GitHub servers)
- Backup: Yahoo Finance (if Polygon fails)
- Manual Input: None - fully automated


---

## üìà DISCOVERED PATTERNS

### Verified Correlations
NONE YET - Will be discovered during analysis phase

### Current Scoring Criteria
CURRENT v5.0.1 CRITERIA - Will be updated based on pattern discovery

### Refinement History
No refinements yet - starting fresh

---

## üéØ DECISIONS MADE

### Key Decisions
1. Mark all previous backtest results as UNVERIFIED
2. Clear all current portfolio positions - starting fresh
3. Build from verified data only - no fabrication
4. Use 500%+ in 6 months as explosive stock criteria
5. Analyze 180 days pre-catalyst for pattern discovery
6. Store all backtest data (picks AND discards) for refinement
7. Apply false miss principle in all backtests
8. User only does copy/paste - full automation required
9. Free data sources only (no paid APIs except Polygon)
10. Use GitHub Actions for full automation (no local execution)


### Rules Established
1. NEVER fabricate data - verify or say you can't
2. FALSE MISS CHECK - Always check discarded stocks for explosive growth
3. STORE EVERYTHING - All decisions, data, refinements must be saved
4. COPY/PASTE ONLY - User should never manually enter data
5. 10-YEAR VALIDATION - System must prove consistency before live trading


---

## üìù WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT

### Immediate Next Steps
1. USER ACTION: Disable old failing Daily GEM Screening workflow (stops emails)
2. USER ACTION: Upload explosive_stock_scanner.py (updated version)
3. USER ACTION: Upload .github/workflows/explosive_stock_scan_workflow.yml (new file)
4. USER ACTION: Click 'Run workflow' in Actions tab
5. AUTOMATED: GitHub Actions runs scanner, commits results
6. USER ACTION: Copy/paste explosive_stocks_catalog.json to Claude
7. AI ACTION: Analyze results, proceed to Phase 3


### Blockers/Questions
None - GitHub Actions has full network access to Polygon API

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NO FABRICATION**: All data must be verified. If unsure, say so immediately.
2. **FALSE MISS PRINCIPLE**: When backtesting, check discarded stocks for explosive growth
3. **USER DOES COPY/PASTE ONLY**: All automation, no manual data entry for user
4. **STORE EVERYTHING**: All backtest data, decisions, refinements must be saved
5. **10-YEAR VALIDATION**: System must work consistently across 10 years before live use
