## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR AI - READ THIS FIRST

### 1. FILE CATALOG MUST BE UPDATED FOR EVERY FILE CREATION - NO EXCEPTIONS!

When AI creates ANY file:
1. ✅ Create file with download link
2. ✅ **IMMEDIATELY UPDATE GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ⏳ PENDING status**
3. ✅ Post GitHub URL for user to copy
4. ✅ Wait for user to upload and paste back
5. ✅ Verify file via web_fetch
6. ✅ **UPDATE GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ✅ VERIFIED status**
7. ✅ Update CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md if major milestone

**This is MANDATORY. Not optional. Not negotiable. ALWAYS.**

See [FILE_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbenson85/GEM_Trading_System/refs/heads/main/FILE_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md) for complete workflow.

### 2. CATCH-UP PROMPT + SYSTEM_STATE.JSON ARE PAIRED FILES - UPDATE BOTH!

**When CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md is updated, system_state.json MUST be updated too!**

These files work together:
- **CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md** = Human-readable narrative
- **system_state.json** = Machine-readable structured data

They must ALWAYS have:
- ✅ Matching timestamps
- ✅ Matching current phase/status
- ✅ Matching next steps
- ✅ Same key information

**Never update one without the other!**

## 📈 DISCOVERED PATTERNS

### Verified Correlations
NONE YET - Will be discovered during Phase 3 analysis

### Current Scoring Criteria
CURRENT v5.0.1 CRITERIA - Will be updated based on Phase 3 pattern discovery

### Refinement History
3 refinements logged:
1. System reset (2025-11-01) - Cleared unverified data
2. COVID-era exclusion rule (2025-11-01) - Exclude 2020-2021 from patterns
3. Expanded historical coverage (2025-11-02) - Added 2010-2012 data (11 stocks)

---

## 🎯 DECISIONS MADE

### Key Decisions
1. ✅ Mark all previous backtest results as UNVERIFIED
2. ✅ Clear all current portfolio positions - starting fresh
3. ✅ Build from verified data only - no fabrication
4. ✅ Use 500%+ in 6 months as explosive stock criteria
5. ✅ Analyze 180 days pre-catalyst for pattern discovery
6. ✅ Store all backtest data (picks AND discards) for refinement
7. ✅ Apply false miss principle in all backtests
8. ✅ User only does copy/paste - full automation required
9. ✅ Free data sources only (no paid APIs except Polygon)
10. ✅ Exclude COVID-era (2020-2021) from pattern analysis
11. ✅ Implement merge logic in filter to prevent data loss
12. ✅ Fix GitHub Actions workflow for full automation (no manual filter runs)
13. ✅ Expand historical coverage back to 2010 for more data
14. ✅ Create comprehensive pre-catalyst analysis framework (12 categories)

### Rules Established
1. **NO FABRICATION** - Verify or say you can't
2. **FALSE MISS CHECK** - Always check discarded stocks for explosive growth
3. **STORE EVERYTHING** - All decisions, data, refinements must be saved
4. **COPY/PASTE ONLY** - User should never manually enter data
5. **10-YEAR VALIDATION** - System must prove consistency before live trading
6. **FILE VERIFICATION** - Every file must be verified using the established protocol
7. **DATA PRESERVATION** - Filter script uses merge logic (no data loss on subsequent scans)
8. **FULL AUTOMATION** - Workflow handles scanning, filtering, and committing without manual steps

## 🔐 FILE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

### **The Problem We Solved:**
AI was creating files without verifying it could read them back from GitHub. This created broken links and lost context between sessions.

### **The Solution - REQUIRED WORKFLOW:**

**When AI Creates New File(s):**

**Step 1**: AI provides files & posts to catalog
- Create file(s) with download links
- Provide file information (location, purpose, contents)
- Immediately update GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ⏳ PENDING status

**Step 2**: AI constructs & posts URLs
- Construct raw GitHub URL(s): `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbenson85/GEM_Trading_System/refs/heads/main/[FILE_PATH]`
- Post URLs in plain text for easy copying
- Say: "Copy these URLs and paste them back after upload:"

**Step 3**: User uploads & pastes URLs back
- User uploads file(s) to GitHub
- User copies the URL(s) from chat
- User pastes them back in chat

**Step 4**: AI verifies files
- AI uses web_fetch on each pasted URL
- AI confirms file contents
- AI updates GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ✅ VERIFIED status
- AI updates CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md if needed

### **Critical Rules:**
- ❌ **AI CANNOT** fetch raw GitHub URLs directly without user providing them first
- ✅ **AI CAN** fetch URLs that user pastes back
- 🔄 **EVERY file** created must follow this verification workflow
- 📝 **EVERY verification** updates the catalog and this prompt
- 🚫 **NO EXCEPTIONS** - If file isn't verified, it doesn't exist to AI

## 🔄 DATA BACKUP SYSTEM (FIXED 2025-11-02)

### **The Problem:**
Original filter script OVERWROTE CLEAN.json and COVID.json files on each run, causing data loss when incremental scans ran.

### **The Solution:**
Updated `filter_covid_era.py` with **MERGE LOGIC**:

**How It Works:**
1. Filter loads existing CLEAN.json and COVID.json (if they exist)
2. Filter reads new stocks from catalog.json
3. Filter merges new stocks (checks for ticker+year duplicates)
4. Filter saves updated cumulative files

**Result:**
- ✅ No data loss on subsequent scans
- ✅ No duplicates (ticker+year key)
- ✅ Accumulates findings over time
- ✅ catalog.json remains "latest scan snapshot"

**Example:**
```
Scan 1 (2014-2024): catalog.json (244 stocks)
→ Filter: CLEAN.json (170) + COVID.json (69)

Scan 2 (2013): catalog.json (199 stocks)
→ Filter: Loads existing 170, adds 19 new = 189 total

Scan 3 (2010-2012): catalog.json (11 stocks)
→ Filter: Loads existing 189, adds 11 new = 200 total

No data loss! ✅
```

## 🔧 GITHUB ACTIONS AUTOMATION (FIXED 2025-11-02)

### **The Problem:**
Workflow was missing the filter step, so user had to manually run `filter_covid_era.py` and push files locally after each scan.

### **The Solution:**
Updated `explosive_stock_scan_workflow.yml` to include:

**New Steps Added:**
1. Run COVID-era filter automatically after scan
2. Verify filter results (show merge statistics)
3. Commit ALL 4 files (catalog.json, CLEAN.json, COVID_ERA.json, filter_summary.json)
4. Push everything to GitHub

**Result:**
- ✅ Full automation - no manual steps needed
- ✅ All files committed and pushed automatically
- ✅ Merge statistics visible in GitHub Actions logs
- ✅ User can trigger scan and walk away

## 📋 DATASET NOTES

### Current CLEAN.json Structure (Inconsistent)
The 200 stocks in CLEAN.json have **TWO different formats**:

**Old Format** (most 2014-2024 stocks):
```json
{
  "ticker": "ABVC",
  "year": 2014,
  "gain_percent": 900,
  "days_to_peak": 28
}
```

**New Format** (2010-2013 stocks, some others):
```json
{
  "ticker": "ABUS",
  "year_discovered": 2013,
  "catalyst_date": "2014-03-10",
  "entry_price": 4.8,
  "peak_price": 30.75,
  "gain_percent": 540.6,
  "days_to_peak": 171,
  "entry_date": "2013-07-03",
  "sector": "Unknown",
  "verified": true,
  "data_source": "Yahoo Finance",
  "all_explosive_windows": 35,
  "covid_era": false
}
```

**Action Required**: Standardize all 200 stocks to unified format before pre-catalyst data collection

### Notable Stocks:
- **ABVC**: Appears in 9 different years (2010-2015, 2018-2019, 2024) with extreme gains
  - 2011: 5,328% gain
  - 2015: 416,567% gain (most extreme ever)
- **ASTH**: Appears in 6 years with strong gains
  - 2013: 3,129% gain
- Dataset spans **15 years** (2010-2024, excluding 2020-2021)
