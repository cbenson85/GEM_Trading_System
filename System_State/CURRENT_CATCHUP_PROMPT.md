## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR AI - READ THIS FIRST

### 1. FILE CATALOG MUST BE UPDATED FOR EVERY FILE CREATION - NO EXCEPTIONS!

When AI creates ANY file:
1. ✅ Create file with download link
2. ✅ **IMMEDIATELY UPDATE GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ⏳ PENDING status**
3. ✅ Post GitHub URL for user to copy
4. ✅ Wait for user to upload and paste back
5. ✅ Verify file via web_fetch
6. ✅ **UPDATE GITHUB_FILE_CATALOG.md with ✅ VERIFIED status**
7. ✅ Update CURRENT_CATCHUP_PROMPT.md if major milestone

**This is MANDATORY. Not optional. Not negotiable. ALWAYS.**

### 2. CATCH-UP PROMPT + SYSTEM_STATE.JSON ARE PAIRED FILES - UPDATE BOTH!

These files work together and must ALWAYS have matching timestamps and status.

## 🎯 CRITICAL CONTEXT

### What You're Walking Into
Sustainability filter V2.0 ran successfully but only passed 17/200 stocks (8.5%). Analysis revealed the issue: testing from peak captures market corrections, not stock quality. Created V3.0 "Sustained Gain Window" filter that tests MINIMUM gain maintained over extended period. This correctly identifies stocks that hold value vs pump & dumps that collapse.

### Immediate Priority
Run Sustained Gain Window Filter V3.0 to get realistic tradeable stock dataset with position management insights.

## 🔬 SUSTAINABILITY FILTER EVOLUTION

### V2.0 Results (COMPLETED)
- **Criteria**: 80% retention, 21 days after peak
- **Result**: 17/200 sustainable (8.5%)
- **Issue Found**: Testing from peak captures market corrections, not stock quality

**Example Problem:**
```
Stock gains 500% over 3 months (SUSTAINABLE)
Market corrects -17% in following 21 days (NOT STOCK-SPECIFIC)
Result: FAILED test (only 83% from peak)
Reality: Stock is still up 500%+ from entry = GOOD!
```

### V3.0 - Sustained Gain Window (READY TO RUN) ⭐

**Methodology:**
1. Find explosive window (entry → peak)
2. Track for 60 days AFTER peak
3. Calculate MINIMUM gain maintained throughout (entry → peak+60)
4. Speed-adjusted thresholds:
   - **FAST** (<30 days to peak): Must hold **250%+ minimum**
   - **MEDIUM** (30-90 days): Must hold **200%+ minimum**
   - **SLOW** (90+ days): Must hold **150%+ minimum**

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Captures sustained strength, not peak timing
- ✅ Market corrections don't disqualify good stocks
- ✅ Pump & dumps show collapse back to entry
- ✅ Speed-adjusted (fast gains = riskier = stricter test)
- ✅ Provides position management data (stop loss references)

**Expected Results:**
- V2.0: 17/200 (8.5%)
- V3.0: 40-80/200 (20-40%) expected
