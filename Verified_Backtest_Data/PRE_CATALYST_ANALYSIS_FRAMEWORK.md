# Pre-Catalyst Analysis Framework - EXPANDED
**Version**: 2.0 - COMPREHENSIVE DATA CAPTURE
**Created**: 2025-11-02
**Purpose**: Cast the widest net - gather ALL observable data 180 days before explosions

---

## 🎯 PHILOSOPHY SHIFT

**OLD Approach:** Narrow focus on price/volume patterns
**NEW Approach:** Gather EVERYTHING, find correlations, backtest, narrow down

### **Core Questions:**
1. What could we have measured/observed 180 days BEFORE the explosion?
2. What separates stocks that exploded from those that didn't?
3. Which data points actually correlate with future explosive gains?

### **Process:**
1. **Cast Wide Net** - Collect ALL possible data points
2. **Find Correlations** - Statistical analysis across 170 stocks
3. **Backtest** - Test which metrics actually predict success
4. **Narrow Down** - Eliminate noise, keep predictive signals
5. **Build Screener** - Create actionable real-time criteria

## 🎯 SAMPLE SELECTION STRATEGY

### **Phase 3B: Comprehensive Sample Analysis (8 stocks)**

**Selection Criteria - Maximum Diversity:**
- Variety of years (2015, 2019, 2022, 2024)
- Variety of gain sizes (500% to 416,000%!)
- Variety of speeds (1 day to 172 days)
- Variety of sectors
- Mix of known vs unknown catalysts
- Mix of small vs medium floats

**Proposed Sample:**

1. **ABVC (2015)** - 416,567% gain in 24 days
   - *Why:* Extreme example, test framework limits
   
2. **AAOI (2024)** - 527% gain in 80 days
   - *Why:* Recent, moderate pace, full data available
   
3. **ATON (2019)** - 12,400% gain in 18 days
   - *Why:* Fast mover, pre-COVID data
   
4. **AXSM (2019)** - 599% gain in 170 days
   - *Why:* Slow build, biotech, known catalyst
   
5. **BBAI (2024)** - 605% gain in 161 days
   - *Why:* Recent slow build, AI sector
   
6. **AKAN (2024)** - 575% gain in 3 days
   - *Why:* Ultra-fast, recent, test rapid explosion patterns
   
7. **ALMU (2024)** - 614% gain in 143 days
   - *Why:* Medium pace, recent, good data
   
8. **AVDL (2022)** - 515% gain in 48 days
   - *Why:* Post-COVID, biotech, medium speed

**Rationale:** This sample covers every explosion archetype:
- Ultra-slow (170 days) to ultra-fast (1-3 days)
- Moderate gains (500%) to extreme (400,000%+)
- Known catalysts vs surprises
- Multiple sectors
- Recent (full data) vs historical

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS FOR PATTERNS

### **What Makes a "Predictive" Pattern?**

**1. High Prevalence (>50% occurrence)**
- Appears in majority of explosive stocks
- Consistently present across years
- Works in different sectors

**2. Strong Correlation (>0.60)**
- Statistical significance
- Consistent relationship with outcome
- Not random chance

**3. Early Signal (Lead Time)**
- Appears BEFORE explosion
- Provides actionable warning
- Enough time to enter position
- Ideal: 7-30 days lead time

**4. Measurable & Screenable**
- Can quantify objectively
- Can screen programmatically
- Available in real-time
- API or scraper accessible

**5. Low False Positive Rate**
- Doesn't appear in non-explosive stocks
- Specific to winners
- Filters out noise

**6. Actionable**
- Clear entry signal
- Defined risk parameters
- Repeatable process

---

## 🚫 CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### **1. No Hindsight Bias**
- ❌ Don't cherry-pick patterns visible only after explosion
- ✅ Focus on patterns observable BEFORE peak
- ✅ Ask: "Could we have seen this in real-time?"

### **2. No Overfitting**
- ❌ Don't create hyper-specific criteria
- ✅ Find broad, robust patterns
- ✅ Test on out-of-sample data

### **3. Include FALSE MISS Analysis Later**
- ❌ Don't only look at winners
- ✅ Phase 4: Check stocks that had patterns but didn't explode
- ✅ Understand false positive rate

### **4. No Confirmation Bias**
- ❌ Don't force patterns to fit expectations
- ✅ Let data reveal patterns objectively
- ✅ Track what DOESN'T correlate too

### **5. Data Quality First**
- ✅ Mark data completeness
- ✅ Note missing data points
- ✅ Weight conclusions by data quality
- ✅ Never fabricate data

---

## 🔄 ITERATION PROCESS

### **After Sample Analysis (8 stocks):**

**Evaluate:**
1. Which data points were most useful?
2. Which data points were impossible to get?
3. Which patterns appeared most frequently?
4. Which metrics showed highest correlation?
5. What surprised us?

**Refine:**
1. Remove useless data points
2. Add newly discovered relevant points
3. Improve quantification methods
4. Streamline collection process
5. Identify automation opportunities

**Decide:**
1. Proceed with full 170-stock analysis?
2. Need more sample stocks first?
3. Adjust framework again?
4. Focus on specific pattern types?
